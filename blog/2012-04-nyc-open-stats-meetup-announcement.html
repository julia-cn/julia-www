  <p>I’ll be giving a talk on Julia at the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/nyhackr/events/60839932/">New York Open Statistical Programming Meetup on May 1st</a>. After my presentation, <a href="http://www.johnmyleswhite.com/">John Myles White</a> and <a href="http://www.statalgo.com/">Shane Conway</a> are going to give followup demos of statistical applications using Julia. Then we’re going to hang out and grab drinks nearby. Thanks to <a href="http://www.harlan.harris.name/">Harlan Harris</a> and <a href="http://www.drewconway.com/">Drew Conway</a> for setting the whole thing up!</p>

<p><strong>Announcement:</strong></p>

<p>After a brief hiatus, we are very excited to announce our May meetup will feature one of the hottest new languages in statistical computing: Julia.  We are delighted to welcome Stefan Karpinski, one of the creators of Julia, to give an introduction to the language and his perspective on statistical computing.</p>

<p>Julia is a general-purpose, high-level, dynamic language in the tradition of Lisp, Perl, Python and Ruby. It is designed to take advantage of modern techniques for executing dynamic languages with statically-compiled performance. As part of this design, the language has an expressive type system, which programmers may leverage for dispatch and error checking — incidentally providing the compiler with useful type information. Using types is entirely optional, however: “typeless Julia” is a valid and useful subset of the language, similar to traditional dynamic languages, which nevertheless runs at statically compiled speeds.\</p>

<p>Julia is especially good at running Matlab and R-style programs. Given its level of performance, we envision a new era of technical computing where libraries can be developed in a high-level language instead of C or Fortran. We have also experimented with cloud API integration, and begun to develop a web-based interactive computing environment. The ultimate goal is to make cloud-based supercomputing as easy and accessible as Google Docs.</p>

<p>We will also hear from a mix of people who have already started developing in Julia and see some examples of what they have developed.</p>

<p>The meetup will follow our typical schedule: pizza will begin at 6:15pm, Stefan will begin promptly at 7pm, and we will head to The Central Bar around 8:30pm.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> You can see the slides for the talk <a href="/images/nyhackr.pdf">here</a>. There was no video of the talk, but hopefully the slides are informative — there are, among other things, a lot of code examples that should just work if pasted into the Julia repl.</p>
