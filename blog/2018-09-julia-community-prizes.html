  <p>The Julia Community Prizes celebrate the amazing set of scientists, developers and designers who have come together build such a strong and diverse ecosystem for numerical computing. Each of the four individuals chosen for the first award in 2018 have made immense contributions to Julia over many years, and all of them have been crucial to Julia’s success.</p>

<p>The prizes were announced at JuliaCon 2018 in London, and each awardee was presented with certificate of accomplishment and a cash prize of $1000.</p>
