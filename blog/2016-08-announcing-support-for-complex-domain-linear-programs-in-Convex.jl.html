  <p>I am pleased to announce the support for complex-domain linear programs (LPs) in Convex.jl. As one of the <em>Google Summer of Code</em> students under <em>The Julia Language</em>, I had proposed to implement the support for complex semidefinite programming. In the first phase of project, I started by tackling the problem of complex-domain LPs where in first subphase, I had announced the support for complex coefficients during <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHG4uEOlMbY">JuliaCon’16</a> and now I take this opportunity to announce the support for complex variables in LPs.</p>

<p>Complex-domain LPs consist of a real linear objective function, real linear inequality constraints, and real and complex linear equality constraints.</p>

<p>In order to enable complex-domain LPs, we came up with these ideas:</p>

<ol>
  <li>We redefined the <strong>conic_form!</strong> of every affine atom to accept complex arguments.</li>
  <li>Every complex variable z was internally represented as <code class="highlighter-rouge">z = z1 + i*z2</code>, where z1 and z2 are real.</li>
  <li>We introduced two new affine atoms <strong>real</strong> and <strong>imag</strong> which return the real and the imaginary parts of the complex variable respectively.</li>
  <li>transpose and ctranspose perform differently on complex variables so a new atom <strong>CTransposeAtom</strong> was created.</li>
  <li>A complex-equality constraint <em>RHS = LHS</em> can be decomposed into two corresponding real equalities constraint <em>real(RHS) = real(LHS)</em> and <em>imag(RHS) = imag(LHS)</em></li>
</ol>

<p>After above changes were made to the codebase, we wrote two use cases to demonstrate the usability and the correctness of our idea which I am presenting below:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code># Importing Packages
Pkg.clone("https://github.com/Ayush-iitkgp/Convex.jl/tree/gsoc2")
using Convex
 
# Complex LP with real variable
n = 10 # variable dimension (parameter)
m = 5 # number of constraints (parameter)
xo = rand(n)
A = randn(m,n) + im*randn(m,n)
b = A * xo 
# Declare a real variable
x = Variable(n)
p1 = minimize(sum(x), A*x == b, x>=0) 
# Notice A*x==b is complex equality constraint 
solve!(p1)
x1 = x.value

# Let's now solve by decomposing complex equality constraint into the corresponding real and imaginary part.
p2 = minimize(sum(x), real(A)*x == real(b), imag(A)*x==imag(b), x>=0)
solve!(p2)
x2 = x.value
x1==x2 # should return true


# Let's now consider an example using a complex variable
# Complex LP with complex variable
n = 10 # variable dimension (parameter)
m = 5 # number of constraints (parameter)
xo = rand(n)+im*rand(n)
A = randn(m,n) + im*randn(m,n)
b = A * xo

# Declare a complex variable
x = ComplexVariable(n)
p1 = minimize(real(sum(x)), A*x == b, real(x)>=0, imag(x)>=0)
solve!(p1)
x1 = x.value

xr = Variable(n)
xi = Variable(n)
p2 = minimize(sum(xr), real(A)*xr-imag(A)*xi == real(b), imag(A)*xr+real(A)*xi == imag(b), xr>=0, xi>=0)
solve!(p2)
x1== xr.value + im*xi.value # should return true
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>List of all the affine atoms are as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>addition, substraction, multiplication, division</li>
  <li>indexing and slicing</li>
  <li>k-th diagonal of a matrix</li>
  <li>construct diagonal matrix</li>
  <li>transpose and ctranspose</li>
  <li>stacking</li>
  <li>sum</li>
  <li>trace</li>
  <li>conv</li>
  <li>real and imag</li>
</ol>

<p>Now, I am working towards implementing complex-domain second order conic programming. Meanwhile, I invite the Julia community to play around with the complex-domain LPs. The link to the development branch is <a href="https://github.com/Ayush-iitkgp/Convex.jl/tree/gsoc2">here</a>.</p>

<p>Looking forward to your suggestions!</p>

<p>Special thanks to my mentors Madeleine Udell and Dvijotham Krishnamurthy!</p>
